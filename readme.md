# Orange Flatpak
This repo is for a manifest so that a flatpak of Orange3, a data mining tool can be made. 


## Why?
The current method of installing Orange on Linux is difficult, and not very intuitive. A flatpak would make life MUCH easier for Linux users. I am currently using Orange for a University class, and I would like the process to be easier for others who use linux and need to use the software for the class.

## Disclaimers
- I am not a developer, or a Flatpak expert by any means. I am also using this project to learn more about *how* to package flatpak apps. Don't expect absolute perfection, at least not yet.

- I, and by extension this repo are not affiliated with the main Orange3 Project. Much love to the original devs for this great tool though! <3
